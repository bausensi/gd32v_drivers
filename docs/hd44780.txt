1: HD44780-based LCD Display
============================
An ubiquitous character LCD display design created by Hitachi in the
decade of 1980. Despite the age of said design, it continues to live
on as a large amount of derivatives that can be found in plenty of
electronic devices such as power meters, remote controllers,
keyboards, calculators

2: Supported Operating Modes
============================
The display is controlled by GPIO bit banging and requires six
consecutive GPIO pins in any port to operate.

LSB to MSB GPIO layout: RS EN D4 D5 D6 D7

4-bit Mode: The display is fed an entire byte of data by writing
two nibbles sequentially. It is the slowest mode of operation but
even on 4-bit mode the display is fast enough for most uses and
it saves four extra GPIO pins compared to the other operating mode
requiring only seven lines, but this driver further decreases it to
six required lines by not supporting display read operations, which
are not needed by the display to function as such.

8-bit mode is NOT SUPPORTED.

3: C Configuration Macros
=========================

ENABLE_HD44780: enables the device driver
HD44780_GPIO_OFFSET: Which GPIO port bit corresponds to the LSB of the
occupied GPIOs
HD44780_TYPE_t: select display configuration t
t: 1602 : 16 or 40 cols by 2 rows
t: 1604 : 16 cols by 4 rows
t: 2002 : 20 cols by 2 rows
t: 2004 : 20 cols by 4 rows
