1: 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor
=========================
A cheap and extremely abundant unipolar stepper motor design found in
3D printers, air conditioning units, DIY maker projects and more in
5V and 12V versions. It can also be modified to be a bipolar stepper
motor but only unipolar operation is supported by this driver.

2: Supported Operating Modes
============================
The stepper motor is controlled by GPIO bit banging and requires four
consecutive GPIO pins in any port to operate.

Wave Drive: The most basic driving mode. A single coil is activated in
a 4 part linear sequence every step. It takes 2048 steps to complete a
full circle.

Full Step: Two coils are active at any given time in a 4 part sequence
every step to increase the torque output and maximum speed of the motor.
It takes 2048 steps to complete a full circle.

Half Step: Two coils are sequenced similarly to full step mode, but in
between each sequence step, one of the coils is deactivated to perform
a half step that yields decreased speeds but higher precision and also
higher torque than wave drive. On half step mode, it takes 4096 half
steps to complete a full circle.

3: C Configuration Macros
=========================

ENABLE_BYJ48: enables the device driver
BYJ48_GPIO_OFFSET: Which GPIO port bit corresponds to the LSB of the
occupied GPIOs
BYJ48_DRIVE_m: select operating mode m
m: HALFSTEP : Half step
m: FULLSTEP : Full step
m: WAVE     : Wave drive
